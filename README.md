The code presented in this repository was developed with the statistical software: R Studio version 3.3.3. 
This work was submitted as part of the partial fulfillment of a cooperative masters program at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) Senegal. The purpose of the script is to perform comparison studies of the Ordinary Least Squares 
(OLS) method when there is error in the independent variable and the Deming regression method. Using the Monte Carlo method, data is simulated to examine how the estimated slope, intercept and residual error depend on the magnitude of the errors.
